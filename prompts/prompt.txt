let me tell you, I want Multi-Application Structure for the Website

I want three separate applications for the same website ecosystem. Each application will have a different purpose and user role, but all of them should work together smoothly.


---

1. User App (Main Application)

This will be the main application for customers or general users.



Installable as an app on mobile (PWA or native)



---

2. Admin Panel App

This application will be used only by administrators.


3. Staff App

This application will be for employees or operational staff.



Installation & Behavior Requirements

All three apps must be installable on the same smartphone

They must not conflict or overwrite each other

Each app should have its own icon, name, and storage



---

Technology Stack & App Type

All three applications should be built as modern History API based Single Page Applications (SPA) combined with Progressive Web App (PWA) capabilities.

Core Requirements:

Use real routing with the History API (no hash-based URLs)

Fast loading and app-like navigation

Offline support (where possible)

Push notifications

Home screen installation like native apps


App Behavior:

Each app must be a separate PWA package

Each must have its own:

App name

Icon

Manifest file

Scope and start URL



This ensures:

All three apps can be installed on the same smartphone

They behave like real standalone apps

No conflicts between storage, cache, or permissions

Smart Auto-Launch from Browser

When a user enters a specific website address in the browser:

User site → opens User App automatically

Admin URL → opens Admin Panel App automatically

Staff URL → opens Staff App automatically


Example links structure:

Main App (User App) → www.blancbeu.in

Admin App → www.blancbeu.in/admin

Staff App → www.blancbeu.in/staff


If the app is installed, it should open directly instead of loading in the browser.
