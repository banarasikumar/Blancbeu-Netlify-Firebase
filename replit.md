# Blancbeu - Premium Beauty & Wellness Salon

## Overview
Blancbeu is a luxurious beauty salon website designed to provide a premium, native app-like experience. It features a sophisticated 24k gold and black theme, stunning animations, and interactive elements. The project aims to offer a magical user experience with a focus on high-end aesthetics and seamless functionality, including a light/dark mode toggle for diverse viewing preferences. Key capabilities include PWA support for installability, optimized performance, and a rich set of beauty service showcases.

## User Preferences
I want to ensure a smooth, professional development process.
- **Communication Style**: Please use clear, concise language. Avoid jargon where simpler terms suffice.
- **Workflow Preferences**: I prefer an iterative development approach. Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps.
- **Interaction Preferences**: Always ask for confirmation before implementing significant changes or refactoring large portions of code. Provide a brief explanation of the proposed changes and their impact.
- **Code Style**: Adhere to modern web standards (HTML5, CSS3, ES6+). Focus on clean, readable, and maintainable code.
- **Deployment**: Ensure all changes are thoroughly tested for cross-browser compatibility and responsiveness before deployment.
- **Design Adherence**: Maintain the premium 24k gold and black aesthetic as a primary design principle.

## System Architecture
The Blancbeu website now uses a **true system-wide theme architecture** leveraging CSS custom properties (variables) to control all colors and styles dynamically across light and dark modes.

### Theme System (Version 16.2.0 - COMPLETE)
- **CSS Variable-Based Architecture**: Complete theme separation using `:root` with dual theme definitions
  - Dark theme (default): 40+ CSS variables for backgrounds, text, shadows, borders, etc.
  - Light theme: Activated via `data-theme="light"` attribute on HTML element
  - ALL colors (100%) use CSS variable references - zero hardcoded colors in production CSS
- **Dynamic Theme Switching**: JavaScript `ThemeController` updates `data-theme` attribute, triggering instant CSS variable changes
- **Zero Theme Mixing**: When theme switches, ALL elements receive updated colors simultaneously from CSS variables
- **Smart Detection**: Automatic theme selection based on time of day (6 AM - 5 PM: Light, 5 PM - 6 AM: Dark) for first-time visitors
- **Persistence**: User theme preference saved in localStorage and restored on subsequent visits

### UI/UX Decisions
- **Theming**: Dual-theme system with dynamic CSS variables. Dark Mode is premium 24k gold on deep black, Light Mode is sophisticated warm/cream on white. Themes are user-toggleable via modern circular glassmorphism button with smooth transitions.
- **Navigation**: iOS-style bottom navigation bar with glassmorphism effects, scroll-based visibility toggling, and theme-aware styling using `data-theme` attribute selectors.
- **Animations**: In dark mode only, incorporates animations including transparent Diwali fireworks overlay, brand name shimmer, sparkling particle backgrounds, offer card glow effects, and rose petal rain. All animations disabled in light mode.
- **Design Elements**: Uses `Cinzel` for luxury headings and `Poppins` for body text. Features glassmorphism with strong blur and shadow depth for interactive elements.
- **Responsiveness**: Fully responsive across all devices with optimized images for various screen sizes.
- **Gallery**: All gallery images correctly mapped to `/assets/service_images/` with proper WebP format
- **Contact Buttons**: Light pastel colors with semi-transparency - Pink (Locate), Green (WhatsApp), Gold (Call) - creating an elegant, sophisticated "Connect with Us" section.

### Technical Implementations
- **Frontend**: Vanilla HTML, CSS, JavaScript for maximum control and performance.
- **Theme System**: CSS custom properties (`--bg-primary`, `--text-primary`, `--shadow-dark`, etc.) defined in `theme-variables.css`. Two complete theme definitions: one for `:root` (dark) and one for `:root[data-theme="light"]`.
- **Color Conversion**: All hardcoded colors in styles.css have been replaced with CSS variables:
  - Text colors: `#1a1a1a`, `#333333`, `#555555`, `#666666`, `#2c3e50` → `var(--text-primary)`, `var(--text-secondary)`, `var(--text-muted)`
  - Background colors: `#ffffff`, `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95/0.9)` → `var(--bg-primary)`, `var(--bg-tertiary)`
  - Gold colors: `#b8860b`, `#d4a017` → `var(--gold-primary)`, `var(--gold-bright)`
  - Gradients: All gradient backgrounds now use theme-aware color variables
- **State Management**: `ThemeController` class manages theme state, synchronizes with localStorage, and updates DOM attributes.
- **CSS Architecture**: Refactored to use CSS variables throughout for colors, backgrounds, shadows, and borders. All hardcoded colors replaced with variable references.
- **Image Optimization**: WebP format with proper paths to `/assets/service_images/` and `/assets/banner_carousel_images/`, resized to display dimensions, lazy loading for performance.
- **Scroll Behavior**: Unified header and bottom navigation visibility management based on scroll events.
- **PWA Support**: Comprehensive Progressive Web App features with custom brand icons, splash screens, and install prompts. Manifest.json configured with correct icon paths.
