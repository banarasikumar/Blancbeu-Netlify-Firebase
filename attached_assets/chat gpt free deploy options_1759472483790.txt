Great — you're specifically looking for free platforms that support dynamic web apps with no sleep (i.e. no auto-shutdown / cold starts due to inactivity).

That's a tough but doable ask — most free tiers do sleep after ~15 mins of inactivity. However, there are a few options that may meet your needs:


---

✅ Free Hosting Platforms With No Sleep (or minimal)

1. Railway (Free Tier)

✅ Supports Node.js, Python, Go, etc.

✅ Sometimes doesn't sleep — especially if traffic is consistent.

⚠️ Limited resources (512 MB RAM), 500 hours/month (shared across projects).

🔗 https://railway.app


Tip: You can keep it awake with a cron job or uptime pinger (like UptimeRobot).


---

2. Fly.io (Free Tier)

✅ Deploy full apps (Node, Go, Rust, etc.) using Docker or buildpacks.

✅ Free VMs with no sleep if used within free monthly resource quota (256MB RAM VM, 3 VMs, 3 GB persistent storage).

✅ Global deployment

🔗 https://fly.io


> Note: No sleep by default — you can run lightweight web apps 24/7 under the free resource budget.




---

3. Render (Free Web Service)

❌ Does sleep after 15 minutes of inactivity on free tier.

✅ Easy to deploy fullstack apps.

🔥 Upgrade to $7/month to remove sleep (or use a pinger workaround).

🔗 https://render.com


So it's not what you're looking for, unless you automate pinging.

4. Oracle Cloud Free Tier ("Always Free" VM)

✅ You get 2 small VMs that run 24/7 — no sleeping

✅ Can run anything: Flask, Django, Node.js, Nginx, PostgreSQL, etc.

⚠️ Slightly complex setup — you manage the Linux VM yourself

---

5. Glitch (with Boosted Apps)

❌ Free apps do sleep after 5 mins idle

✅ But with "Boosted" (invite only or small fee), it runs always on

Bonus: Keep Free Apps Awake with Pingers (Not always allowed)

If the platform sleeps your app after 15 mins of inactivity, use:

UptimeRobot (Free: pings your app every 5 mins)

Cron-job.org (Free cron ping service)

Self-hosted keep-alive script from another service


> ⚠️ Some platforms (like Render) may ban this behavior if abused. Always check the terms.

Fly.io	✅ Yes	3 VMs, 256MB RAM each, 160GB/mo egress	Medium (Docker CLI)	Great for small apps
Railway	⚠️ Sometimes	500 hrs/month, 512MB RAM	Easy	May sleep without traffic
Oracle Cloud	✅ Yes	2x 1GB RAM VMs, Always Free	Harder (manual setup)	Full control, no sleep
Render	❌ No	750 hrs/month, sleeps after 15 min idle	Easy	Need ping trick or upgrade
Glitch	❌ Yes (paid)	Free sleeps; Boosted stays awake	Very easy	Good for prototyping
